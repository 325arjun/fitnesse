To introduce Slim's script table we use a simple example:

|script             |login test fixture                                       |
|login with username|Bob                     |and password|secret             |
|check              |number of login attempts|1                               |
|reject             |login with username     |Fried       |and password|secret|
|show               |number of login attempts                                 |

The contents of the class used in this sample is quite simple, as the next script will show in full development setup...

!|script      |file fixture                    |
|set directory|../src/main/java                |
|show         |content of|LoginTestFixture.java|

In the standalone.zip the Java source is not included (only the compiled version), so to ensure everyone sees it I also copied its current contents here in the wiki
{{{
/**
 * Fixture to explain script table. Simplified from FitNesse's LoginDialogDriver.
 */
public class LoginTestFixture {
    private int counter;

    public boolean loginWithUsernameAndPassword(String username, String password) {
        counter = counter + 1;
        return "Bob".equals(username)
                && "secret".equals(password);
    }

    public int numberOfLoginAttempts() {
        return counter;
    }
}
}}}
