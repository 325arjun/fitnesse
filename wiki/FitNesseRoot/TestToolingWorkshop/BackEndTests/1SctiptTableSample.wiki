To introduce Slim's script table we use a simple example:

|script             |login test fixture                                       |
|login with username|Bob                     |and password|secret             |
|check              |number of login attempts|1                               |
|reject             |login with username     |Fried       |and password|secret|
|show               |number of login attempts                                 |

The contents of the class used in this sample is quite simple, as the next script will show...

!|script      |file fixture                    |
|set directory|../src/main/java                |
|show         |content of|LoginTestFixture.java|
